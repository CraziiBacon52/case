      <h2>What is Zoom?</h2>
      <p>Zoom is a tool that is used for video conferencing. This allows large
        groups to see each other through a video, communicate, and share screens
        all from their homes.</p>

          If you don't, go to the section above and follow the steps. Open up the
          app on your computer and sign into your account. Click the downward arrow
          on the 'start meeting' section. (It's an orange button). Check 'start with video'

          <!--Joining a meeting-->
        <h3 id="sectionD" style = "margin-top:75">Joining a Meeting</h3>
          <p>When joining a meeting, the host will most likely send you either a link or a code. If you got a link:
            When it is time to join the call, click the link. You will either automatically join the call or be
             placed in a waiting room, where you wait for the host to let you in.</p>
          <p>If they send you a code, then open the zoom app. Click the button that says 'join meeting'
            and input the code that was given to you. You can also type your name in which will be displayed
            as you join the call.</p>
          <!--Using Microphone and video-->
        <h3 id="sectionE" style = "margin-top:75">Using Microphone and Video</h3>
        <p>On the bottom of your screen on a call, there are multiple options.
           Two of them are the microphone and video. One is a picture of a microphone
           and the other is a camera the says 'video' underneath it. To turn off your video,
           click the button that says video. This way, no one can see you. If you want to turn it
           back on, click it again. So that people can't hear you, click the microphone button.
           To turn it back on, click it again.</p>

        <p>Open the Zoom app and click the little gear in the top right corner (settings)

        <p>One useful function of this section is that you get a preview of your video.
          This can be good to look at before you join a call. In the image where there
          is a cartoon is where your video will appear.</p>
        <p>Under the section entitled 'my video', you can click 'touch up my appearance'.
           This simply smooths out your face by retouching your video.</p>

          <!--Recording Meetings-->
        <h3 id="sectionG" style = "margin-top:75">Recording Meetings</h3>
        <p>Once you are in a meeting, there is an option at the bottom of the screen that says 'record'

your computer and will also be visible in the 'recordings' tab of your zoom app.</p>

  <!--Sharing Screens-->
  <h3 id="sectionH" style = "margin-top:75">Screen Sharing</h3>
    <p>At the bottom there is an option that says 'screen sharing'. If you are the host, you will
      automatically have the option. Otherwise, the host has to give you permission to share your screen.</p>
