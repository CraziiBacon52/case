      <h2>What is Google?</h2>
      <p>Google is an extremely important tool! Not only is it a great search
        engine that is universally used, but it also offers other useful functions
        through a google drive. You can create spreadsheets, documents, slideshows
         and much more! Here's how to create your google account and the basics of
          using some of the tools available.</p>
          <!--Creating your google Account-->
        <h2 id="sectionA">Creating a Google Account</h2>
        <p>Open the Chrome app on your computer. Click the button below (this will take you to the Google Sign-up page)</p>
          <a style = "margin-bottom: 20" href="https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp" class="btn btn-outline-dark btn-sm" tabindex="-1" role="button" aria-disabled="false">Google's Signup Page</a>
        <p>To create an account, you will need to fill in your first and last name as well as your email. You don't need a gmail account (it's usually done with one, but you can use your current email instead by pressing 'use my current email'). You also will need to fill in your desired password and confirm it.
If you use the option 'use my current email address', you will need to confirm it with a code sent to this existing email.</p>
