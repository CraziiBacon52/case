                                                    Then, click the theme that you would like to use.</h3>
                                                  <h3>On a website called Slides Carnival, there are tons of less basic themes. These can range from super simple to more complex designs.
                                                    These are also fairly easy to use.</h3>
                                                  <h3>Scroll through them. Once you've found the one that you like, scroll down (don't click view and download), and then click 'Use as a Google Slides Theme'. This will open up a preview of the
                                                    slides. If you decide that you like this theme, click 'Use Template.'</h3>
                                                  <h3>This will create an entirely new slideshow title the theme's name (this is changeable). You can delete slides and create new ones, these will have the theme.</h3>

                                                    very convenient and make slides look great.</h3>

                                                    Click the one that you want to use and then press insert. You can also add images from your drive, which means that if you
                                                    have any images in your drive, you can insert them as well. If you have a URL of the image, then you can also insert it by this method.</h3>
